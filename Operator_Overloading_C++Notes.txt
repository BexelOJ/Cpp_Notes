In C++, you can overload a wide range of operators to work with user-defined types. Here's a list of all the operators that can be overloaded in C++:

--------------------------------------------
1. Arithmetic Operators:

+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)

--------------------------------------------
2. Relational Operators:

== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
< (Less than)
> (Greater than)
<= (Less than or equal to)
>= (Greater than or equal to)

--------------------------------------------
3. Logical Operators:

&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)

--------------------------------------------
4. Bitwise Operators:

& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)

--------------------------------------------
5. Assignment Operators:

= (Assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
&= (Bitwise AND and assign)
|= (Bitwise OR and assign)
^= (Bitwise XOR and assign)
<<= (Left shift and assign)
>>= (Right shift and assign)

--------------------------------------------
6. Increment and Decrement Operators:

++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)

--------------------------------------------
7. Array Subscript Operator:

[] (Array subscript)

--------------------------------------------
8. Function Call Operator:

() (Function call)

--------------------------------------------
9. Pointer to Member Operator:

-> (Pointer to member)
.* (Pointer to member function)

--------------------------------------------
10. Type Conversion Operator:

type(), e.g., operator int()

--------------------------------------------
11. Comma Operator:

, (Comma operator)

--------------------------------------------
12. Typeid Operator:

typeid (Can be overloaded as part of a class, but not globally)

--------------------------------------------
13. New and Delete Operators:

new (Memory allocation)
new[] (Array memory allocation)
delete (Memory deallocation)
delete[] (Array memory deallocation)

--------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------
15. Stream Insertion and Extraction Operators:

<< (Stream insertion)
>> (Stream extraction)

--------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------
17. Other Operators:

[] (Array subscript)
& (Address-of operator)
* (Dereference operator)
-> (Member selection operator)

--------------------------------------------

14. Class and Object-specific Operators:

:: (Scope resolution operator) — Cannot be overloaded
. (Dot operator)               — Cannot be overloaded
.* (Pointer-to-member operator) — Can be overloaded
->* (Pointer-to-member operator) — Can be overloaded

16. Conditional Operator (Ternary):

? : (Ternary conditional operator) — Cannot be overloaded

sizeof (Size of operator) — Cannot be overloaded
alignof (Align of operator) — Cannot be overloaded
alignas (Align as operator) — Cannot be overloaded

--------------------------------------------
Important Notes:
Some operators cannot be overloaded (e.g., ::, .*, sizeof, typeid, etc.).
While you can overload most operators, it's important to overload them in a way that preserves the logical consistency of your program. 
For example, overloading the + operator for a class should logically make sense as an addition operation.
